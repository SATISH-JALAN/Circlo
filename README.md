Welcome to **Circlo** — the peer-to-peer rental marketplace where your garage becomes a treasure chest, your community becomes your network, and every rental is a win for the planet! 🌍

## 🚀 What is Circlo?
Circlo is a vibrant platform designed to power the circular economy. Here, you can rent out items you rarely use, borrow what you need, and even discover cultural artifacts in the **Cultural Vault**. Every transaction helps reduce waste, save money, and build a more connected, sustainable world.

### Why "Circlo"?
Because we believe in circles: sharing, cycling, and sustainability. The "o" is a symbol of completeness, community, and the endless loop of giving and receiving.
